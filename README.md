what is this gay thing bro!
```
this is a dumper for vmstate and shets its used to bypass the "leave-crash" when u inject ingame
lets say you used "solara" and u injected, but when you left it crashes! too annoying right?
well the solution is to use VMSTATE, set loadingstate to 0 and find a way to trigger that script lmaoo
this works cause i use this method
```
